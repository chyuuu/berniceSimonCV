        <p>I was born in the Philippines (yes I’m a citizen and yes I’m authorized to work in the US), but raised in Maryland, USA! believe it or not, I actually don’t like crabs, but I do love Maryland. I have a background in Chemistry and
          Biochemistry, but that never stopped me from pursuing other interests like coding, design, and recently, finance! I like to think I can do almost anything you throw at me. that's thanks to my inability to say no so I picked up on whatever I was needed for in the moment so at least I can say  I’m pretty useful to have around. I’m a super quick learner. if I wasn’t running around in a typical work day, was I actually working? <br /><br />outside of work, I take pride in the <a class="aboutlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFeeAC/" target="_blank">r/nofeeac</a> community that I
          built along with
          some friends. volunteer work counts towards experience, too, right? we wanted to build a community of giving and kindness in the animal crossing world, and nofeeac was born. check out an article about us in <a class="aboutlink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/10/animal-crossing-new-horizon-capitalist-dystopia-subreddit" target="_blank">the guardian</a>!
          we’ve also done interviews for vox, though that article was never published. it was still pretty cool to do, though :) <br /><br /> more often, you’ll find me hiking. I touch grass too, sometimes!<br /><br />want to chat? email me or let’s connect on
          linkedin!</p>
