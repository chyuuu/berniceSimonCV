        <p>I was born in the Philippines (yes I am a citizen and yes I am authorized to work in the US), but raised in Maryland, USA! believe it or not, I actually donâ€™t like crabs, but I do love Maryland. I have a background in chemistry and
          biochemistry, but that never stopped me from pursuing other interests like coding, design, project management, and now, clinical data management! I like to think I can do almost anything you throw at me. that's thanks to my inability to say no (just kidding, I am much better at this now) so I picked up on whatever I
          was needed for in the moment so at least I can say I am pretty useful to have around. I am an insanely quick learner!<br /><br />outside of work, I take pride in the <a
            class="extlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFeeAC/" target="_blank">r/nofeeac</a> community that I have the honor in running with some great friends. volunteer work counts towards experience, too, right? we wanted to build a community of giving and kindness in the animal crossing world, and r/nofeeac was born. check out an article about us in <a class="extlink"
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/10/animal-crossing-new-horizon-capitalist-dystopia-subreddit" target="_blank">the guardian</a>!
          weâ€™ve also done interviews for vox, though that article was never published. it was still pretty cool to do, though :) <br /><br /> more often, youâ€™ll find me hiking or exploring a new museum or exhibit in DC. I touch grass too, sometimes! and as of 10 apr 2025, I have a 598 day streak for French on duolingo! ðŸ”¥ <br /><br />did I perhaps... pique your interest? want to chat some more? <a class="extlink"
