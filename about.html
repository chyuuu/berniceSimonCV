        <p>I was born in the Philippines (yes I’m a citizen and yes I’m authorized to work in the US), but raised in Maryland, USA! believe it or not, I actually don’t like crabs, but I do love Maryland. I have a background in Chemistry and
          Biochemistry, but that never stopped me from pursuing other interests like coding, design, and recently, finance! I like to think I can do almost anything you throw at me thanks to how overworked I was, but mostly because I just have those
          skills too and I’m pretty useful to have around. I’m a super quick learner. if I wasn’t running around in a typical work day, was I actually working? <br /><br />outside of work, I take pride in the <a href="">r/nofeeac</a> community that I built along with
          some friends. volunteer work counts towards experience, too, right? we wanted to build a community of giving and kindness in the animal crossing world, and nofeeac was born. check out an article about us in <a href="">the guardian</a>! we’ve also done
          interviews for vox, though that article was never published. it was still pretty cool to do, though :) <br /><br /> more often, you’ll find me hiking. I touch grass too, sometimes. <br /><br />want to chat? email me or let’s connect on linkedin!</p>
